Edited version of the plan created around week 3 in which tasks were specified better, the start of dependencies and a better view on the timing

Edited version of the plan created around week 4 in which the dependencies were growing, as well as the inclusion of parralel work. There were still some polishing to do, difference in typing for everyone
